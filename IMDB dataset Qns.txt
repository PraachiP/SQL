SQL Questions on IMDB Dataset.


Note: the pid's, mid's might have spaces at starting and ending, so when you are comparing it's suggested to use TRIM() function.


Q1. List all the directors who directed a 'Comedy' movie in a leap year. (You need to check that the genre is 'Comedyâ€™ and year is a leap year) Your query should return director name, the movie name, and the year.
Ans:-
select p.name Director_Name, m.title Movie_Name, m.year
from movie m JOIN 
m_director d
ON trim(m.mid) = trim(d.mid)
JOIN person p
ON trim(d.pid) = trim(p.pid)
JOIN m_genre MG
ON trim(m.mid) = trim(MG.mid)
JOIN genre G
ON G.gid = MG.gid
where m.year%4 = 0
AND m.year % 100 <> 0
OR m.year % 400 = 0
AND G.name like '%Comedy%';


Q2. List the names of all the actors who played in the movie 'Anand' (1971)
Ans:- 
1>	 select p.name Actor

where m.title = 'Anand'
AND trim(c.mid) = trim(m.mid)
AND trim(c.pid) = trim(p.pid);
2>	select p.name Actor
from person p JOIN m_cast c
ON trim(c.pid) = trim(p.pid)
JOIN movie m
ON trim(c.mid) = trim(m.mid)

SELECT distinct p.name
FROM person p 
JOIN
(SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(MC.PID) PID
 FROM Movie M JOIN M_Cast MC 
 ON M.MID = MC.MID
 WHERE M.year < 1970) Y70 
 ON Y70.PID = TRIM(P.PID)
 JOIN
 (SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(MC.PID) PID
 FROM Movie M JOIN M_Cast MC 
 ON M.MID = MC.MID
 WHERE M.year > 1990) Y90
 ON Y90.PID = Y70.PID;
